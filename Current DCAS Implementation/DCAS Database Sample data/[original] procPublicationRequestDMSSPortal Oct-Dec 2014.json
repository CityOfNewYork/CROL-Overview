It is necessary to relocate the panels\nin order to extend a corridor that is currently blocked by the wall on which\nthe panels are located (see attached plan). The corridor in question must be\nextended to maintain circulation and egress on the 4th floor that will be lost\nwhen DANY\u2019s Cybercrimes and Identity Theft Unit (CITB) is renovated and\nexpanded. This expansion will absorb a section of the circulation corridor\nwhich will then be replaced by extending the corridor blocked by the electric\npanels in question. Please see the attached drawings.

The renovation and expansion of the CITB unit is a pivotal component\nof District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance\u2019s strategy to combat one of the fastest\ngrowing sectors of crime worldwide. The renovation is scheduled to begin in\nDecember of this year and be completed and occupied by the middle of August of\n2015. The panels must be relocated by the start of construction. Waiting until\nthe building-wide electrical upgrade is completed in 2015, in order to seek\ncompetitive bids from multiple electrical contractors to relocate the panels,\nwould substantially delay this project and would also delay an important crime\nprevention initiative. Because DCAS prefers not to issue a change order to the\ncontractor for the panel relocation, nor to revise the scope of the electrical\nupgrade project to accommodate the relocation, DANY has agreed to fund the\nwork and hire the contractor as a separate project. We are thus seeking to\nretain ARK Systems Electric to relocate the panels, under their current\npermit, concurrent with the building-wide electrical upgrade.
