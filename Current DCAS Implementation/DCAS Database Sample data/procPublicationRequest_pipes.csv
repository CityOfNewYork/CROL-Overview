DEP estimates that the maximum shutdown duration would be approximately eight months. During this temporary shutdown of the RWBT, water from the Delaware system west of the Hudson River would be unavailable. To ensure the continued supply of clean drinking water during this time, DEP has developed projects and plans comprised of three main components: (1) supply augmentation consisting of&nbsp; rehabilitation of the Catskill Aqueduct and rehabilitation of groundwater supply stations in Queens; (2) WFF Shutdown System Operations, which would allow DEP to rely more heavily on the Catskill and Croton water supply systems during the temporary shutdown; and (3) Inspection and Repair of the RWBT during connection of the bypass tunnel, including decommissioning the bypassed section of the RWBT once the connection is completed.</p> <p> 	&nbsp;</p> <p> 	The subject of this draft scope and EIS is comprised of the rehabilitation of the Catskill Aqueduct, WFF Shutdown System Operations, and Inspection and Repair of the RWBT. These components collectively will be referred to as Upstate Water Supply Resiliency in the Draft Scope of Work. The Queens Groundwater Rehabilitation project will be referred to as In-City Water Supply Resiliency, which will be the subject of a subsequent environmental review.&nbsp;</p> <p> 	&nbsp;</p> <p> 	The public comment period will remain open until December 5, 2014, and a Final Scope of Work, incorporating changes based on relevant comments received, will be issued.</p> <p> 	&emsp;</p> <p> 	The Draft Scope of Work was issued on October 10, 2014 and is available for review on the DEP website. DEP will hold public meetings for public comment on the Upstate Water Supply Resiliency Draft Scope of Work&nbsp;with informal information and listening sessions taking place one hour prior to the meeting times&nbsp;on:</p> <p> 	&nbsp;</p> <p> 	Thursday, November 13, 2014, at 7:00 PM</p> <p> 	Town of Newburgh Town Hall, 1496 Route 300, Newburgh, NY&nbsp; 12550</p> <p> 	&nbsp;</p> <p> 	Friday, November 14, 2014, at 7:00 PM</p> <p> 	SUNY Sullivan &ndash; Paul Grossinger Dining Room</p> <p> 	112 College Road, Loch Sheldrake, NY 12759</p> <p> 	&nbsp;</p> <p> 	Wednesday, November 19, 2014, at 7:00 PM</p> <p> 	Ellenville Government Center, 2 Elting Court, Ellenville, NY 12428</p> <p> 	&nbsp;</p> <p> 	Thursday, November 20, 2014 at 7:00 PM</p> <p> 	Yorktown Town Hall, Town Board Room</p> <p> 	363 Underhill Avenue, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598</p>

The Applicant is also seeking a special permit pursuant to Section 13-451 to allow for an accessory parking garage (collectively, the &ldquo;proposed actions&rdquo;). The proposed actions would facilitate a proposal by the Applicant to construct a 128,713 gross square foot (gsf) mixed use building on a single zoning lot&nbsp; (Block 825, Lots 20, 60, and 1001-1005, the &ldquo;project site&rdquo;).&nbsp; The project site is located at 39-41 West 23rd Street and 20-22 West 24<sup>th</sup> Street in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan, Community District 5. The project site is located in an M1-6 zoning district and is within the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC) designated Ladies&rsquo; Mile Historic District.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The proposed actions would facilitate a proposal by the Applicant to transfer approximately 24,000 gsf of unused development rights from Lot 1001-1005 to Lots 20 and 60 in order to construct a new, mixed use residential and commercial 128,713 gsf building. The Applicant&rsquo;s development proposal would consist of 119,173 gsf of residential space (40 market-rate units), 2,500 gsf of retail space, and a 50-space public parking garage accessed by an existing curb cut along West 24<sup>th</sup> Street. The proposed new development would consist of two towers, a 24-story (278-foot tall) residential tower facing West 23rd Street and a 10-story (130-foot-tall) residential tower facing West 24th Street, atop a building base containing retail, parking garage, and residential lobby uses. The east side of the proposed new building would cantilever over a five-story existing building located on Lot 1001-1005. &nbsp;</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  At present, Lot 20 is occupied by a public parking lot containing 42 spaces. Lot 60, located to the west of Lot 20 on West 24th Street, is currently vacant. Lot 1001-1005, located to the east of Lot 20, is currently occupied by an 80-foot-tall, residential and retail building that is a contributing building in the Ladies&rsquo; Mile Historic District.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  For the purposes of a conservative analysis, a Reasonable Worst Case Development Scenario (RWCDS) assumes the project site would be developed with an average dwelling unit size&nbsp; of 1,000 gsf, smaller than the average dwelling unit size anticipated by the applicant.&nbsp; The RWCDS assumes the same amount of residential floor area (119,173 gsf) as the proposed project, but with 75 more dwelling units for a total of 115 market rate units. It is expected that the proposed project would be constructed and occupied by 2017.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  Absent the proposed actions, the Applicant has stated that Lots 20 and 60 would be developed with a seven story (77-foot-tall roof and 80-foot-tall parapet) 45,862 sf commercial building that complies with the underlying zoning regulations. The development would contain approximately 8,152 sf of retail space on the first floor and approximately 37,710 sf of office space on the upper floors. The development would require a Certificate of Appropriateness from LPC.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The proposed actions include an (E) designation (E-356) applicable to a portion of the project site (Block 825, Lots 20 and 60). The (E) designation would preclude significant adverse impacts related to air quality, noise, and hazardous materials.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The text for the (E) designation related to air quality is as follows:</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>Any new residential and/or commercial development on the above-referenced properties must ensure that heating and hot water equipment exhaust stack(s) on the above-referenced property must be located at the highest tier or at least 281 feet high to avoid any potential significant air quality impacts. </strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>  The text for the (E) designation related to noise is as follows:</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>To ensure an acceptable interior noise environment, the building fa&ccedil;ade(s) or future development at Block 825, Lots 20 and 60 must provide a minimum of 31 dBA composite building fa&ccedil;ade attenuation at elevations up to 100 feet above the street level and 28 dBA at elevations between 101 and 200 feet above street level for the fa&ccedil;ade along West 23rd Street for residential or other noise-sensitive uses, to provide an interior L10 noise level not greater than 45 dBA. The minimum required composite building fa&ccedil;ade attenuation for future commercial or other non-noise-sensitive uses would be 5 dBA less than for residential uses, to provide an interior L10 noise level not greater than 50 dBA. To maintain a closed-window condition in these areas, an alternate means of ventilation that brings outside air into the building without degrading the acoustical performance of the building fa&ccedil;ade(s) must also be provided.</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The text for the (E) designation related to hazardous materials is as follows:</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>Task 1: Sampling Protocol</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>Prior to construction</strong><strong>, the Applicant submits to OER, for review and approval, a Phase II Investigation protocol, including a description of methods and a site map with all sampling locations clearly and precisely represented.</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>No sampling should begin until written approval of a protocol is received from OER.

The characterization should be complete enough to determine what remediation strategy (if any) is necessary after review of the sampling data. Guidelines and criteria for selecting sampling locations and collecting samples are provided by OER upon request.</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>Task 2: Remediation Determination and Protocol</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>A written report with findings and a summary of the data must be submitted to OER after completion of the testing phase and laboratory analysis for review and approval.

The Applicant must complete such remediation as determined necessary by OER. The Applicant should then provide proper documentation that the work has been satisfactorily completed.</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>An OER-approved construction health and safety plan would be implemented during evacuation and construction and activities to protect workers and the community from potentially significant adverse impacts associated with contaminated soil and/or groundwater.

The proposed action would facilitate the construction of an approximately 214,539 gross square foot (gsf) eleven-story, mixed-use building containing hotel, residential, commercial, and community facility uses.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The project site is located in a R6/C2-2 district which allows residential and community facility Use Groups 1 through 4, with a permitted residential floor area ratio (FAR) ranging from 0.78 to 2.43 and a community facility FAR of 4.8. The existing C2-2 commercial overlay permits Use Groups 1 through 9 and 14 and a maximum commercial FAR of 2.0. The proposed action seeks to extend the C4-3 zoning district to the south of the project site to facilitate a mixed use building with a wider range of commercial uses than what would be permitted on an as-of-right-basis. The proposed C4-3 zoning district permits Use Groups 1 through 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 and a commercial FAR of up to 3.4, a residential FAR of between 0.78 and 2.43, and a community facility FAR of up to 4.8.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The project site, Block 4960, Lot 29, is currently developed with a one-story 25,300 square foot (sf) supermarket and an accessory parking lot containing 38 parking spaces. Vehicular access to the parking lot is provided via curb cuts onto Northern Boulevard and Leavitt Street. The rezoning boundary also extends beyond the project site and includes portions of the following non-Applicant owned lots: Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 63 and Block 4977, Lot 130. These parcels are not expected to be redeveloped or enlarged as a result of the proposed action. Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 62 are developed with one- to three-family residential buildings. Block 4960, Lot 63 is developed with a City owned parking lot that serves Flushing Town Hall, a Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC) designated landmark and National Register listed site located directly west of the project site. The rezoning area extends 125 feet in from the Northern Boulevard street line, therefore approximately 0.16 feet (two inches) in width of Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 62 would be zoned C4-3. The remainder of the C2-2 commercial overlay would be removed from these lots and would maintain their effective R6 zoning. In addition, a portion of the Daniel Carter Beard Memorial Park mall (Block 4977, Lot 130) is within the proposed rezoning boundary. It is an open space area owned by the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation. The eastbound and westbound lanes of Northern Boulevard are divided by this partially landscaped and partially paved median strip.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The proposed action would facilitate a proposal by the applicant to construct an approximately 214,539 gsf eleven-story mixed-use building on the project site. The proposed development would include approximately 43 dwelling units within 40,299 gsf of floor area, 191 hotel rooms within 103,554 gsf of floor area, 11,273 gsf of accessory retail space, and approximately 7,890 gsf of community facility space (non-profit club). The proposed development would also include 155 accessory attended parking spaces (plus 16 reservoir spaces), 33 bicycle parking spacing, and one loading berth. The cellar level of the building would be used for hotel parking and accessed from ramps on the basement level on Leavitt Street and by vehicle elevators. The first floor of the building would be used for residential parking garage and would be accessed from ramps on the basement level on Leavitt Street.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The proposed project is expected to be completed by 2017.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  Absent the proposed action, the project site would be developed with a 174,174 gsf eleven-story mixed-use building. The building would include 72 dwelling units within 74,553 gsf of floor area, 33,771 gsf of community facility space (non-profit club), and 21,820 gsf of retail space. The proposed development would also include 143 accessory attended parking spaces (plus 15 reservoir spaces) and one loading berth.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The proposed actions include an (E) designation (E-355) applicable to the project site (Block 4960, Lot 29).

The rezoning area is bounded by Fort Hamilton Parkway, 55<sup>th</sup> Street, 9<sup>th</sup> Avenue, and 53<sup>rd</sup> Street, and is located within the Borough Park neighborhood in Brooklyn, Community District 12. The proposed action would facilitate a proposal by the applicant to construct a 50,669 square foot (sf), mixed-use development containing 45,055 sf of community facility uses and 5,614 sf of commercial uses on Lots 42 and 50 (&ldquo;project site&rdquo;). The proposed development would also include an accessory parking garage with 150 spaces, accessed by a proposed curb-cut along 54<sup>th</sup> Street.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The project site currently contains 11,167 square feet of lot area. Lot 42, at the southwest corner of Fort Hamilton Parkway and 54<sup>th</sup> Street, is a former auto repair establishment, consisting of a vacant garage building and paved area that is fenced and unused.&nbsp; Lot 50, located to the south of the corner lot and fronting on Fort Hamilton Parkway, contains a narrow, vacant three-story former mixed use building. Portions of two parcels (Lot 41 of Block 5673 and part of Lot 50 of Block 5666), not under the applicant&rsquo;s control, are located within the boundaries of the proposed rezoning. Lot 41, to the west of the project site, contains a three-story residential building. Lot 50, to the north of the project site, is occupied by the Monastery of the Precious Blood institution. The parcels not under the applicant&rsquo;s control are not expected to be redeveloped or enlarged as a result of the proposed action.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The existing R5/C1-3 zoning permits a FAR of 1.25 for residential use and 2.0 for community facility uses. The proposed rezoning would increase the permitted FAR for residential use to 2.43 and community facility use to 4.8.</p> <p>  For the purposes of a conservative analysis, the Reasonable Worst Case Development Scenario (RWCDS) analyzed in the Environmental Assessment Statement (EAS) assumes that the project site would be developed with a 99,034 gsf building containing 57,890 sf of medical office uses, 5,614 sf of retail commercial uses, and an accessory parking garage containing 151 parking spaces occupying up to 35,530 sf. The garage would be accessed via a proposed new curb cut located on 54<sup>th</sup> Street.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The proposed project is expected to be constructed and occupied by 2016.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  Absent the proposed action, the applicant has stated that the project site would be developed with a three-story 52,272 gsf medical office and retail building pursuant to the existing R5/C1-3 zoning. An 82-space accessory parking garage, accessed via a new curb cut on 54<sup>th</sup> Street, would also be provided.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The proposed action includes an (E) designation (E-341) applicable to the project site (Block 5673, Lots 42 and 50). The (E) designation would preclude significant adverse impacts related to air quality, noise, and hazardous materials.</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The text for the (E) designation related to air quality is as follows:</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>Any new residential and/or commercial development on the above-referenced property must use natural gas for HVAC systems to avoid any potential significant adverse air quality impacts. </strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The text for the (E) designation related to noise is as follows:</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>To ensure an acceptable interior noise environment, future residential uses must provide a closed-window condition with a minimum OITC rating of 28 dBA window/wall attenuation to maintain an interior noise level of 45 dBA. To maintain a closed-window condition, an alternate means of ventilation must also be provided. Alternate means of ventilation includes, but is not limited to, air conditioning. For commercial uses, the requirement would be 5 dBA lower, or 23 dBA.</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The text for the (E) designation related to hazardous materials is as follows:</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>Task 1 &ndash; Sampling Protocol</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>The fee owner of the lots restricted by this (E) designation is required to submit to OER, for review and approval, an updated Phase I of the site along with a soil, groundwater and soil vapor testing protocol, including a description of methods and a site map with all sampling locations clearly and precisely represented. No sampling shall begin until written approval of a protocol is received from OER. The number and location of samples should be selected to adequately characterize the site, specific sources of suspected contamination (i.e., petroleum based contamination and non-petroleum based contamination), and the remainder of the site&rsquo;s condition. The characterization should be complete enough to determine what remediation strategy (if any) is necessary after review of sampling data. Guidelines and criteria for selecting sampling locations and collecting samples are provided by OER upon request. </strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>Task 2 &ndash; Remediation Determination Protocol</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>A written report with findings and a summary of the data must be submitted to OER after completion of the testing phase and laboratory analysis for review and approval.

The fee owner of the lots shall then provide proper documentation that the work has been satisfactorily completed. </strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>A construction-related health and safety plan must be submitted to OER for approval and then implemented during excavation and construction activities to protect workers and the community from potentially significant adverse impacts associated with contaminated soil, groundwater and/or soil vapor. </strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  <strong>Statement of No Significant Effect:</strong></p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <p>  The Environmental Assessment and Review Division of the Department of City Planning, on behalf of the City Planning Commission, has completed its technical review of the Environmental Assessment Statement, dated October 17, 2014, prepared in connection with the ULURP Application 140288ZMK. The City Planning Commission has determined that the proposed action will have no significant effect on the quality of the environment, once it is modified as follows:</p> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <ol>  <li>   The applicant agrees to contact the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) within six months after the completion of this project and to inform them of the need to implement the following traffic mitigation measures:</li> </ol> <p>  &nbsp;</p> <ul>  <li>   A three second signal timing shift at the intersection of 54<sup>th</sup> Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway in order to restore overall acceptable operating levels for the ea
