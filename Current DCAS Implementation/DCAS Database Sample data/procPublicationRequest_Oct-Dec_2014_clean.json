  "AdditionalDescription": "Release of the Draft Scope of Work for Water for the Future Upstate Water\nSupply Resiliency Project and Schedule of Public Meetings\n\n\n\nTo repair significant leaks in the Rondout-West Branch Tunnel (RWBT) of the\nDelaware Aqueduct, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection\n(DEP) developed the Water for the Future Program (WFF).  As part of the\nprogram, DEP elected to construct a bypass tunnel and two associated shafts to\npermanently circumvent the leaking section of the tunnel at the Roseton\ncrossing in the Town of Newburgh, NY, and to conduct internal repairs to the\nleaking section in Wawarsing, NY.  This project was previously evaluated in a\nFEIS issued on May 18, 2012, and work has commenced.\n\n\n\nOnce the tunnel and shafts are completed in 2022, the RWBT would be\ntemporarily shut down and drained to connect the bypass tunnel to the existing\nRWBT and to carry out internal repairs. DEP estimates that the maximum\nshutdown duration would be approximately eight months. During this temporary\nshutdown of the RWBT, water from the Delaware system west of the Hudson River\nwould be unavailable. To ensure the continued supply of clean drinking water\nduring this time, DEP has developed projects and plans comprised of three main\ncomponents: (1) supply augmentation consisting of  rehabilitation of the\nCatskill Aqueduct and rehabilitation of groundwater supply stations in Queens;\n(2) WFF Shutdown System Operations, which would allow DEP to rely more heavily\non the Catskill and Croton water supply systems during the temporary shutdown;\nand (3) Inspection and Repair of the RWBT during connection of the bypass\ntunnel, including decommissioning the bypassed section of the RWBT once the\nconnection is completed.\n\n\n\nThe subject of this draft scope and EIS is comprised of the rehabilitation of\nthe Catskill Aqueduct, WFF Shutdown System Operations, and Inspection and\nRepair of the RWBT. These components collectively will be referred to as\nUpstate Water Supply Resiliency in the Draft Scope of Work. The Queens\nGroundwater Rehabilitation project will be referred to as In-City Water Supply\nResiliency, which will be the subject of a subsequent environmental review.\n\n\n\nThe public comment period will remain open until December 5, 2014, and a Final\nScope of Work, incorporating changes based on relevant comments received, will\nbe issued.\n\n\n\nThe Draft Scope of Work was issued on October 10, 2014 and is available for\nreview on the DEP website. DEP will hold public meetings for public comment on\nthe Upstate Water Supply Resiliency Draft Scope of Work with informal\ninformation and listening sessions taking place one hour prior to the meeting\ntimes on:\n\n\n\nThursday, November 13, 2014, at 7:00 PM\n\nTown of Newburgh Town Hall, 1496 Route 300, Newburgh, NY  12550\n\n\n\nFriday, November 14, 2014, at 7:00 PM\n\nSUNY Sullivan \u2013 Paul Grossinger Dining Room\n\n112 College Road, Loch Sheldrake, NY 12759\n\n\n\nWednesday, November 19, 2014, at 7:00 PM\n\nEllenville Government Center, 2 Elting Court, Ellenville, NY 12428\n\n\n\nThursday, November 20, 2014 at 7:00 PM\n\nYorktown Town Hall, Town Board Room\n\n363 Underhill Avenue, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598\n\n",

  "AdditionalDescription": "39-41 West 23rd Street\n\nCEQR 14DCP167M- NEGATIVE DECLARATION\n\n\n\nThe Applicant, 39 W. 23rd Street, LLC, is seeking a special permit pursuant to\nZoning Resolution (ZR) Section 74-711 to modify the rear yard equivalent\nregulations of Section 43-28, the rear yard regulations of Section 43-313, the\nstreetwall height and sky exposure plane regulations of Section 43-43, and the\nuse regulations of Section 42-10 to allow Use Group 2 residential uses. The\nApplicant is also seeking a special permit pursuant to Section 13-451 to allow\nfor an accessory parking garage (collectively, the \u201cproposed actions\u201d). The\nproposed actions would facilitate a proposal by the Applicant to construct a\n128,713 gross square foot (gsf) mixed use building on a single zoning lot\n(Block 825, Lots 20, 60, and 1001-1005, the \u201cproject site\u201d).  The project site\nis located at 39-41 West 23rd Street and 20-22 West 24th Street in the\nFlatiron neighborhood of Manhattan, Community District 5. The project site is\nlocated in an M1-6 zoning district and is within the New York City Landmark\nPreservation Commission (LPC) designated Ladies\u2019 Mile Historic District.\n\n\n\nThe proposed actions would facilitate a proposal by the Applicant to transfer\napproximately 24,000 gsf of unused development rights from Lot 1001-1005 to\nLots 20 and 60 in order to construct a new, mixed use residential and\ncommercial 128,713 gsf building. The Applicant\u2019s development proposal would\nconsist of 119,173 gsf of residential space (40 market-rate units), 2,500 gsf\nof retail space, and a 50-space public parking garage accessed by an existing\ncurb cut along West 24th Street. The proposed new development would consist of\ntwo towers, a 24-story (278-foot tall) residential tower facing West 23rd\nStreet and a 10-story (130-foot-tall) residential tower facing West 24th\nStreet, atop a building base containing retail, parking garage, and\nresidential lobby uses. The east side of the proposed new building would\ncantilever over a five-story existing building located on Lot 1001-1005.  \n\n\n\nAt present, Lot 20 is occupied by a public parking lot containing 42 spaces.\nLot 60, located to the west of Lot 20 on West 24th Street, is currently\nvacant. Lot 1001-1005, located to the east of Lot 20, is currently occupied by\nan 80-foot-tall, residential and retail building that is a contributing\nbuilding in the Ladies\u2019 Mile Historic District.\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of a conservative analysis, a Reasonable Worst Case\nDevelopment Scenario (RWCDS) assumes the project site would be developed with\nan average dwelling unit size  of 1,000 gsf, smaller than the average dwelling\nunit size anticipated by the applicant.  The RWCDS assumes the same amount of\nresidential floor area (119,173 gsf) as the proposed project, but with 75 more\ndwelling units for a total of 115 market rate units. It is expected that the\nproposed project would be constructed and occupied by 2017.\n\n\n\nAbsent the proposed actions, the Applicant has stated that Lots 20 and 60\nwould be developed with a seven story (77-foot-tall roof and 80-foot-tall\nparapet) 45,862 sf commercial building that complies with the underlying\nzoning regulations. The development would contain approximately 8,152 sf of\nretail space on the first floor and approximately 37,710 sf of office space on\nthe upper floors. The development would require a Certificate of\nAppropriateness from LPC.\n\n\n\nThe proposed actions include an (E) designation (E-356) applicable to a\nportion of the project site (Block 825, Lots 20 and 60). The (E) designation\nwould preclude significant adverse impacts related to air quality, noise, and\nhazardous materials.\n\n\n\nThe text for the (E) designation related to air quality is as follows:\n\n\n\n**Any new residential and/or commercial development on the above-referenced properties must ensure that heating and hot water equipment exhaust stack(s) on the above-referenced property must be located at the highest tier or at least 281 feet high to avoid any potential significant air quality impacts.**\n\n       \n\nThe text for the (E) designation related to noise is as follows:\n\n\n\n**To ensure an acceptable interior noise environment, the building fa\u00e7ade(s) or future development at Block 825, Lots 20 and 60 must provide a minimum of 31 dBA composite building fa\u00e7ade attenuation at elevations up to 100 feet above the street level and 28 dBA at elevations between 101 and 200 feet above street level for the fa\u00e7ade along West 23rd Street for residential or other noise-sensitive uses, to provide an interior L10 noise level not greater than 45 dBA. The minimum required composite building fa\u00e7ade attenuation for future commercial or other non-noise-sensitive uses would be 5 dBA less than for residential uses, to provide an interior L10 noise level not greater than 50 dBA. To maintain a closed-window condition in these areas, an alternate means of ventilation that brings outside air into the building without degrading the acoustical performance of the building fa\u00e7ade(s) must also be provided.**\n\n\n\nThe text for the (E) designation related to hazardous materials is as follows:\n\n\n\n**Task 1: Sampling Protocol**\n\n\n\n**Prior to construction****, the Applicant submits to OER, for review and approval, a Phase II Investigation protocol, including a description of methods and a site map with all sampling locations clearly and precisely represented.**\n\n\n\n**No sampling should begin until written approval of a protocol is received from OER. The number and location of sample sites should be selected to adequately characterize the site, the specific source of suspected contamination (i.e., petroleum-based contamination and non-petroleum-based contamination), and the remainder of the site\u2019s condition. The characterization should be complete enough to determine what remediation strategy (if any) is necessary after review of the sampling data. Guidelines and criteria for selecting sampling locations and collecting samples are provided by OER upon request.**\n\n\n\n**Task 2: Remediation Determination and Protocol**\n\n\n\n**A written report with findings and a summary of the data must be submitted to OER after completion of the testing phase and laboratory analysis for review and approval. After receiving such results, a determination is made by OER if the results indicate that remediation is necessary. If OER determines that no remediation is necessary, written notice shall be given by OER.**\n\n\n\n**If remediation is indicated from the test results, a proposed remedial action plan must be submitted to OER for review and approval. The Applicant must complete such remediation as determined necessary by OER. The Applicant should then provide proper documentation that the work has been satisfactorily completed.**\n\n\n\n**An OER-approved construction health and safety plan would be implemented during evacuation and construction and activities to protect workers and the community from potentially significant adverse impacts associated with contaminated soil and/or groundwater. This plan would be submitted to OER for review and approval prior to implementation.**\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "AdditionalDescription": "**_XU HOTEL AND RESIDENCES REZONING_**\n\n**_13DCP106Q - NEGATIVE DECLARATION_**\n\n\n\nThe applicant, CG & J Realty LLC, is seeking a zoning map amendment to rezone\nBlock 4960, Lot 29 (the \u201cproject site\u201d) and part of Lots 28, 57, 58, 59, 60,\n61, 62, and 63 and part of Block 4977, Lot 130, from a R6/C2-2 district to\nC4-3 and R6 districts in the Downtown Flushing neighborhood of Queens,\nCommunity District 7 (the \u201cproposed action\u201d). The proposed action would\nfacilitate the construction of an approximately 214,539 gross square foot\n(gsf) eleven-story, mixed-use building containing hotel, residential,\ncommercial, and community facility uses.\n\n\n\nThe project site is located in a R6/C2-2 district which allows residential and\ncommunity facility Use Groups 1 through 4, with a permitted residential floor\narea ratio (FAR) ranging from 0.78 to 2.43 and a community facility FAR of\n4.8. The existing C2-2 commercial overlay permits Use Groups 1 through 9 and\n14 and a maximum commercial FAR of 2.0. The proposed action seeks to extend\nthe C4-3 zoning district to the south of the project site to facilitate a\nmixed use building with a wider range of commercial uses than what would be\npermitted on an as-of-right-basis. The proposed C4-3 zoning district permits\nUse Groups 1 through 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 and a commercial FAR of up to 3.4, a\nresidential FAR of between 0.78 and 2.43, and a community facility FAR of up\nto 4.8.\n\n\n\nThe project site, Block 4960, Lot 29, is currently developed with a one-story\n25,300 square foot (sf) supermarket and an accessory parking lot containing 38\nparking spaces. Vehicular access to the parking lot is provided via curb cuts\nonto Northern Boulevard and Leavitt Street. The rezoning boundary also extends\nbeyond the project site and includes portions of the following non-Applicant\nowned lots: Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 63 and Block 4977, Lot 130.\nThese parcels are not expected to be redeveloped or enlarged as a result of\nthe proposed action. Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 62 are developed with\none- to three-family residential buildings. Block 4960, Lot 63 is developed\nwith a City owned parking lot that serves Flushing Town Hall, a Landmark\nPreservation Commission (LPC) designated landmark and National Register listed\nsite located directly west of the project site. The rezoning area extends 125\nfeet in from the Northern Boulevard street line, therefore approximately 0.16\nfeet (two inches) in width of Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 62 would be\nzoned C4-3. The remainder of the C2-2 commercial overlay would be removed from\nthese lots and would maintain their effective R6 zoning. In addition, a\nportion of the Daniel Carter Beard Memorial Park mall (Block 4977, Lot 130) is\nwithin the proposed rezoning boundary. It is an open space area owned by the\nNYC Department of Parks and Recreation. The eastbound and westbound lanes of\nNorthern Boulevard are divided by this partially landscaped and partially\npaved median strip.  \n\n\n\nThe proposed action would facilitate a proposal by the applicant to construct\nan approximately 214,539 gsf eleven-story mixed-use building on the project\nsite. The proposed development would include approximately 43 dwelling units\nwithin 40,299 gsf of floor area, 191 hotel rooms within 103,554 gsf of floor\narea, 11,273 gsf of accessory retail space, and approximately 7,890 gsf of\ncommunity facility space (non-profit club). The proposed development would\nalso include 155 accessory attended parking spaces (plus 16 reservoir spaces),\n33 bicycle parking spacing, and one loading berth. The cellar level of the\nbuilding would be used for hotel parking and accessed from ramps on the\nbasement level on Leavitt Street and by vehicle elevators. The first floor of\nthe building would be used for residential parking garage and would be\naccessed from ramps on the basement level on Leavitt Street.\n\n\n\nThe proposed project is expected to be completed by 2017.\n\n\n\nAbsent the proposed action, the project site would be developed with a 174,174\ngsf eleven-story mixed-use building. The building would include 72 dwelling\nunits within 74,553 gsf of floor area, 33,771 gsf of community facility space\n(non-profit club), and 21,820 gsf of retail space. The proposed development\nwould also include 143 accessory attended parking spaces (plus 15 reservoir\nspaces) and one loading berth.\n\n\n\nThe proposed actions include an (E) designation (E-355) applicable to the\nproject site (Block 4960, Lot 29). The (E) designation would preclude\nsignificant adverse impacts related to noise and hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nThe text for the (E) designation related to noise is as follows:\n\n\n\n**In order to ensure an acceptable interior noise environment, future residential uses must provide a closed window condition with a minimum window-wall attenuation of 31 dB(A) along the project\u2019s Northern Boulevard fa\u00e7ade and 28 dB(A) on other building facades in order to maintain an interior noise level of 45 dB(A). In order to maintain a closed-window condition, an alternate means of ventilation must also be provided. Alternate means of ventilation includes, but is not limited to, central air conditioning or air conditioning sleeves containing air conditioners.**\n\n\n\nThe text for the (E) designation related to hazardous materials is as follows:\n\n\n\n**_Task 1_**\n\n**The fee owners of the lot restricted by this (E) designation will be required to prepare a scope of work for any soil, gas, or groundwater sampling and testing needed to determine if contamination exists, the extent of the contamination, and to what extent remediation may be required.

This scope of work will be submitted to the Mayor\u2019s Office of Environmental Remediation (OER) for review and approval prior to implementation. It will be reviewed to ensure that an adequate number of samples will be collected and that appropriate parameters are selected for laboratory analysis.**\n\n\n\n**No sampling program may begin until written approval of a work plan and sampling protocol is received from the OER. The number and location of sample sites should be selected to adequately characterize the type and extent of the contamination, and the condition of the remainder of the site.

The proposed development would also\ninclude an accessory parking garage with 150 spaces, accessed by a proposed\ncurb-cut along 54th Street.\n\n\n\nThe project site currently contains 11,167 square feet of lot area. Lot 42, at\nthe southwest corner of Fort Hamilton Parkway and 54th Street, is a former\nauto repair establishment, consisting of a vacant garage building and paved\narea that is fenced and unused.  Lot 50, located to the south of the corner\nlot and fronting on Fort Hamilton Parkway, contains a narrow, vacant three-\nstory former mixed use building. Portions of two parcels (Lot 41 of Block 5673\nand part of Lot 50 of Block 5666), not under the applicant\u2019s control, are\nlocated within the boundaries of the proposed rezoning. Lot 41, to the west of\nthe project site, contains a three-story residential building. Lot 50, to the\nnorth of the project site, is occupied by the Monastery of the Precious Blood\ninstitution. The parcels not under the applicant\u2019s control are not expected to\nbe redeveloped or enlarged as a result of the proposed action.\n\n\n\nThe existing R5/C1-3 zoning permits a FAR of 1.25 for residential use and 2.0\nfor community facility uses. The proposed rezoning would increase the\npermitted FAR for residential use to 2.43 and community facility use to 4.8.\n\nFor the purposes of a conservative analysis, the Reasonable Worst Case\nDevelopment Scenario (RWCDS) analyzed in the Environmental Assessment\nStatement (EAS) assumes that the project site would be developed with a 99,034\ngsf building containing 57,890 sf of medical office uses, 5,614 sf of retail\ncommercial uses, and an accessory parking garage containing 151 parking spaces\noccupying up to 35,530 sf. The garage would be accessed via a proposed new\ncurb cut located on 54th Street.\n\n\n\nThe proposed project is expected to be constructed and occupied by 2016.\n\n\n\nAbsent the proposed action, the applicant has stated that the project site\nwould be developed with a three-story 52,272 gsf medical office and retail\nbuilding pursuant to the existing R5/C1-3 zoning. An 82-space accessory\nparking garage, accessed via a new curb cut on 54th Street, would also be\nprovided.\n\n\n\nThe proposed action includes an (E) designation (E-341) applicable to the\nproject site (Block 5673, Lots 42 and 50). The (E) designation would preclude\nsignificant adverse impacts related to air quality, noise, and hazardous\nmaterials.\n\n\n\nThe text for the (E) designation related to air quality is as follows:\n\n\n\n**Any new residential and/or commercial development on the above-referenced property must use natural gas for HVAC systems to avoid any potential significant adverse air quality impacts.**\n\n\n\nThe text for the (E) designation related to noise is as follows:\n\n\n\n**To ensure an acceptable interior noise environment, future residential uses must provide a closed-window condition with a minimum OITC rating of 28 dBA window/wall attenuation to maintain an interior noise level of 45 dBA. To maintain a closed-window condition, an alternate means of ventilation must also be provided. Alternate means of ventilation includes, but is not limited to, air conditioning. For commercial uses, the requirement would be 5 dBA lower, or 23 dBA.**\n\n\n\nThe text for the (E) designation related to hazardous materials is as follows:\n\n\n\n**Task 1 \u2013 Sampling Protocol**\n\n\n\n**The fee owner of the lots restricted by this (E) designation is required to submit to OER, for review and approval, an updated Phase I of the site along with a soil, groundwater and soil vapor testing protocol, including a description of methods and a site map with all sampling locations clearly and precisely represented. No sampling shall begin until written approval of a protocol is received from OER. The number and location of samples should be selected to adequately characterize the site, specific sources of suspected contamination (i.e., petroleum based contamination and non-petroleum based contamination), and the remainder of the site\u2019s condition. The characterization should be complete enough to determine what remediation strategy (if any) is necessary after review of sampling data. Guidelines and criteria for selecting sampling locations and collecting samples are provided by OER upon request.**\n\n\n\n**Task 2 \u2013 Remediation Determination Protocol**\n\n\n\n**A written report with findings and a summary of the data must be submitted to OER after completion of the testing phase and laboratory analysis for review and approval. After receiving such results, a determination is made by OER if the results indicate that remediation is necessary. If OER determines that no remediation is necessary, written notice shall be given by OER.**\n\n\n\n**If OER determines that remediation is necessary based on test results, a proposed remediation plan must be submitted to OER for review and approval. The fee owner of the lots must complete such remediation as determined necessary by OER. The fee owner of the lots shall then provide proper documentation that the work has been satisfactorily completed.**\n\n\n\n**A construction-related health and safety plan must be submitted to OER for approval and then implemented during excavation and construction activities to protect workers and the community from potentially significant adverse impacts associated with contaminated soil, groundwater and/or soil vapor.**\n\n\n\n**Statement of No Significant Effect:**\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Assessment and Review Division of the Department of City\nPlanning, on behalf of the City Planning Commission, has completed its\ntechnical review of the Environmental Assessment Statement, dated October 17,\n2014, prepared in connection with the ULURP Application 140288ZMK. The City\nPlanning Commission has determined that the proposed action will have no\nsignificant effect on the quality of the environment, once it is modified as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n  1. The applicant agrees to contact the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) within six months after the completion of this project and to inform them of the need to implement the following traffic mitigation measures: \n\n\n\n  * A three second signal timing shift at the intersection of 54th Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway in order to restore overall acceptable operating levels for the ea \n\n",

The public hearing will take place at 11:00am on Monday, December 8, 2014. The hearing will be in Hearing Room A at the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, located at 100 Church Street, 12th Floor, NY, NY 10007. \n\n\n\n**How do I comment on the proposed rules? ** Anyone can comment on the proposed rules by: \n\n\n\n  * **Website. ** You can submit comments to SAPO through the NYC rules Web site at [www.nyc.gov/nycrules](http://rules.cityofnewyork.us/). \n\n\n\n  * **Email. ** You can email written comments to [saporules@cityhall.nyc.gov](mailto:saporules@cityhall.nyc.gov). \n\n\n\n  * **Mail. ** You can mail written comments to Emil Lissauer, Deputy Executive Director, Citywide Coordination and Management, at 100 Gold Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10038. \n\n\n\n  * **Fax.** You can fax written comments to SAPO, 212-312-0759. \n\n\n\n  * **By Speaking at the Hearing. ** Anyone who wants to comment on the proposed rule at the public hearing must sign up to speak.  You can sign up before the hearing by calling Emil Lissauer at (212) 788-7567 by close of business on December 5, 2014.

A few days after the hearing, a transcript of the hearing and copies of the written comments will be available to the public at SAPO. \n\n\n\n**What authorizes SAPO to make this rule?** Section 1043 of the City Charter as well as Executive Orders No. 100 and No. 105 authorize SAPO to make this proposed rule.  This proposed rule was not included in SAPO\u2019s regulatory agenda for this Fiscal Year because it was not contemplated when SAPO published the agenda. \n\n\n\n**Where can I find the SAPO rules? ** The SAPO rules are in title 50 of the Rules of the City of New York. \n\n\n\n**What rules govern the rulemaking process?** SAPO must meet the requirements of Section 1043 of the City Charter when creating or changing rules. This notice is made according to the requirements of Section 1043 of the City Charter. \n\n  \n\n\n**_Statement of Basis and Purpose of Proposed Rule_**\n\n\n\nThe Office of Citywide Events Coordination and Management (OCECM), Street\nActivity Permit Office (SAPO) administers New York City\u2019s permit system for\nstreet activities, block parties and fairs.\n\n\n\nEach year SAPO issues permits to over 200 street fairs and over 5,000 other\nevents, most of which  include the use of multiple blocks over several days,\nthe erection of structures, the vending of food, apparel and other goods and\nthe use of amplified sound and the performance of music.  Events like these\nrequire additional police officers which increases overtime costs to the City.\nThese events also divert police officers from core crime fighting, public\nsafety and counter terrorism duties.\n\n\n\nTo more effectively deploy police resources and control overtime costs, the\nNew York City Police Department has requested that SAPO exercise its\ndiscretion temporarily to deny permits for additional events scheduled for\ncalendar year 2015.  The proposed rules will authorize SAPO to deny permits to\nthese events only if the event was not held in the calendar year 2014. Events\nthat received permits in calendar year 2014 will be eligible to receive\npermits again in calendar year 2015.\n\n\n\nSAPO authority for these rules is found in section 1043 of the New York City\nCharter and Executive Order No. 105 of 2007.\n\n\n\n_New material is underlined._\n\n_[_Deleted material is in brackets.]\n\n\n\n\u201cShall\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d denote mandatory requirements and may be used\ninterchangeably in the rules of this department, unless otherwise specified or\nunless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\n\n\nSection 1-05(d) of Chapter 1 of Title 50 of the Rules of the City of New York\nis amended to read as set forth below.\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) For the calendar year [2014] _2015_, the Director shall deny applications\nfor street activity permits for street fairs not held in the calendar year\n[2013] _2014_.\n\n",

The proposed Lease term is 20 years, with an option to extend\nfor ten more years, and obligates Pier55, Inc. to commit substantial funding\nfor the reconstruction of Pier 54 (to be located between the existing Pier 54\nfootprint and the Pier 56 pile field) and for the on-going operation and\nmaintenance of the completed pier.  The Lease contemplates that Pier55, Inc.\nwould redevelop the new pier as public open park space that would also serve\nas a cultural events space within the Park. Pier55, Inc. would fund the\noperations of cultural events on the new pier, with a majority of events each\nyear to be available to the public on a free or low cost basis. The permitted\nevents that Pier55, Inc. would fund and produce include: public performances\nof vocal, instrumental and other music; dramatic works, opera, theater and\npublic readings of prose or poetry; public talks by academics, writers and\npublic figures; performance art; dance performances; art displays,\ninstallations and exhibitions; films; and other similar events.  Pier55, Inc.\nwould also be allowed to conduct fundraising events and operate limited\nconcessions on the pier.  The Trust will also use the new pier for its\nprogramming and events.  The new pier will be open and accessible to the\npublic consistent with overall Park\u2019s operating hours, with closures limited\nto the extent reasonably necessary for safety or to accommodate permitted\nevents.  The proposed Lease also includes other information on security,\nmaintenance and other operational requirements and obligations of both Pier55,\nInc. and the Trust.\n\n\n\nThe proposed Lease would require a minimum design and construction financial\ncommitment by Pier55 Inc. of over one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000).\nIn addition, Pier55, Inc. will be responsible for all costs associated with\ncultural programming, and for the cost of maintaining the landscape and other\npier amenities.  The Lease provides that, after ten years, Pier55, Inc. may\neither continue to operate and maintain the pier for the remainder of the\nLease term, or make a contribution to support its future maintenance.  The\nTrust has committed to expend seventeen million dollars ($17,000,000) in City\ncapital funds, and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in other public\nmonies, towards Pier 54\u2019s redevelopment, and to be responsible for maintaining\nthe support piles and other structural components of the pier.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the 1998 Hudson River Park General Project Plan will be amended\nto reflect the current plans for the redevelopment of Pier 54.\n\n\n\nA copy of the proposed Lease and Amendment to the General Project Plan\nAmendment can be found on the Trust\u2019s website at\n[www.hudsonriverpark.org](http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/).  A copy of a draft\nof the Environmental Assessment Statement for the proposed project can also be\nfound on the Trust\u2019s website.\n\n\n\n           \n\nIn addition to the public hearing, the public will have an opportunity to\nprovide written comments to the Trust.  The public comment period extends from\nNovember 17, 2014 to January 16, 2015. Comments may be sent by regular mail to\nWilliam Heinzen, Esq., Hudson River Park Trust, Pier 40, 2nd Floor, 353 West\nStreet, New York, N.Y. 10014 or by email to\n[Pier54comments@hrpt.ny.gov](mailto:Pier54comments@hrpt.ny.gov).

The proposed Lease term is 20 years, with an option to extend\nfor ten more years, and obligates Pier55, Inc. to commit substantial funding\nfor the reconstruction of Pier 54 (to be located between the existing Pier 54\nfootprint and the Pier 56 pile field) and for the on-going operation and\nmaintenance of the completed pier.  The Lease contemplates that Pier55, Inc.\nwould redevelop the new pier as public open park space that would also serve\nas a cultural events space within the Park. Pier55, Inc. would fund the\noperations of cultural events on the new pier, with a majority of events each\nyear to be available to the public on a free or low cost basis. The permitted\nevents that Pier55, Inc. would fund and produce include: public performances\nof vocal, instrumental and other music; dramatic works, opera, theater and\npublic readings of prose or poetry; public talks by academics, writers and\npublic figures; performance art; dance performances; art displays,\ninstallations and exhibitions; films; and other similar events.  Pier55, Inc.\nwould also be allowed to conduct fundraising events and operate limited\nconcessions on the pier.  The Trust will also use the new pier for its\nprogramming and events.  The new pier will be open and accessible to the\npublic consistent with overall Park\u2019s operating hours, with closures limited\nto the extent reasonably necessary for safety or to accommodate permitted\nevents.  The proposed Lease also includes other information on security,\nmaintenance and other operational requirements and obligations of both Pier55,\nInc. and the Trust.\n\n\n\nThe proposed Lease would require a minimum design and construction financial\ncommitment by Pier55 Inc. of over one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000).\nIn addition, Pier55, Inc. will be responsible for all costs associated with\ncultural programming, and for the cost of maintaining the landscape and other\npier amenities.  The Lease provides that, after ten years, Pier55, Inc. may\neither continue to operate and maintain the pier for the remainder of the\nLease term, or make a contribution to support its future maintenance.  The\nTrust has committed to expend seventeen million dollars ($17,000,000) in City\ncapital funds, and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in other public\nmonies, towards Pier 54\u2019s redevelopment, and to be responsible for maintaining\nthe support piles and other structural components of the pier.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the 1998 Hudson River Park General Project Plan will be amended\nto reflect the current plans for the redevelopment of Pier 54.\n\n\n\nA copy of the proposed Lease and Amendment to the General Project Plan\nAmendment can be found on the Trust\u2019s website at\n[www.hudsonriverpark.org](http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/).  A copy of a draft\nof the Environmental Assessment Statement for the proposed project can also be\nfound on the Trust\u2019s website.\n\n\n\n           \n\nIn addition to the public hearing, the public will have an opportunity to\nprovide written comments to the Trust.  **The public comment period extends\nfrom November 17, 2014 to January 23, 2015**.

This rule proposal was not included in the\nregulatory agenda because it was not contemplated at the time of publication\nof the regulatory agenda.\n\n\n\nNotice regarding a public hearing about the amendment was first published on\nNovember 7, 2014, with the agency accepting comments until December 8, 2014.\nThe agency was prepared to make available for public inspection all written\nand oral comments it received on the matter, within a reasonable time after\nreceipt, between the hours of 9:30 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. at the Office of\nCitywide Events Coordination and Management, 100 Gold Street, 2nd Floor, New\nYork, New York 10038.

Almost all of these events involve permits for the use of multiple blocks over several days, the erection of structures, the vending of food, apparel and other goods and the use of amplified sound and the performance of music.  Such events require additional police presence and increase overtime expenditure by the City.  In order to effectively deploy police resources, the New York City Police Department has requested for the calendar year 2015 that SAPO exercise its discretion temporarily to deny permits for additional events that place an excessive burden on police resources and divert uniformed personnel from core crime fighting, public safety and counter terrorism duties. \n\n            In the interests of protecting the City and its inhabitants, these rules will authorize SAPO to deny permits to events scheduled for calendar year 2015, the anticipated effective date of the proposed rules, if the event was not held in the calendar year 2014, the year prior to the effective date of the proposed rules. \n\n\n\n            SAPO authority for these rules is found in section 1043 of the New York City Charter and Executive Order No. 105 of 2007. \n\n\n\n_New material is underlined._\n\n_[_Deleted material is in brackets.]\n\n\u201cShall\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d denote mandatory requirements and may be used\ninterchangeably in the rules of this department, unless otherwise specified or\nunless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\n\n\nSection 1-05(d) of Chapter 1 of Title 50 of the Rules of the City of New York\nis amended to read as set forth below.\n\n(d) For the calendar year [2014] _2015_, the Director shall deny applications\nfor street activity permits for street fairs not held in the calendar year\n[2013] _2014_.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_Statement of Substantial Need for Earlier Implementation_\n\nI hereby find, pursuant to Section 1043(f)(1)(c) of the New York City Charter,\nthat there is a substantial need for the implementation, immediately upon its\nfinal publication in The City Record, of a rule to clarify practices and\nprocedures related to permitting events on City streets, including but not\nlimited to extending, for an additional one-year period, the authority of the\nDirector of the Office of Citywide Event Coordination and Management (OCECM),\nset forth in section 1-05(d) of chapter 1 of Title 50 of the Rules of the City\nof New York, to deny applications for street activity permits for events not\nheld in the preceding calendar year and to promulgate a fee schedule for\ncertain street activity permits.\n\nOver 200 SAPO-permitted street fairs and over 5,000 events occur annually\nwithin the City.  Almost all of these events involve permits for the use of\nmultiple blocks over several days, the erection of structures, the vending of\nfood, apparel and other goods and the use of amplified sound and the\nperformance of music.
