These organizations are the employers of over 6000 child care professionals and support staff 

The Day Care Council of New York, Inc. (“The Council”) has been designated by the Child Care Not-for-Profit providers represented by District Council 1707/Local 205 of AFSCME and The Council of Supervisors and Administrators (CSA) to serve as their representative in all collective bargaining issues negotiations and agreements.  Additionally, The Council provides grievance-mediation services, recruitment and personnel assistance.  Training and technical assistance is also provided to ensure consistency and efficiency throughout the childcare community.

ACS cannot perform these negotiations with the unions on behalf of the contracted agencies and their staffs, because ACS is not the employer.  However, City funding is used to adjudicate any grievances, fund collective bargaining issues and other negotiations affecting contracts with our child care vendors.  It is therefore advantageous to the City to provide funding to The Council to advocate for ACS’ not-for-profit agencies.  Additionally, based upon correspondence from the City of New York’s Office of Labor Relations (OLR) pertaining to lawsuits brought by unions against the City claiming the City was a “joint employer” with contract vendor agencies; the City prevailed in these cases because it was not a signatory to collective bargaining agreements between these unions and the vendor agencies and it did not directly provide wages or benefits to these employees.  The Council’s contract will eliminate the appearance that the City is a joint employer of the not-for-profit employees.

The Council’s unique expertise, service and configuration are the primary basis for this sole source method determination.  It conforms to the first condition for a sole source procurement, that there be only one source for the required service pursuant to section 3-05 of the PPB rules.

The Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) contracts with over 115 not-for-profit organizations to operate childcare programs and provide services in 290 locations throughout the five boroughs.  These organizations are the employers of over 6000 child care professionals and support staff 

The Day Care Council of New York, Inc. (“The Council”) has been designated by the Child Care Not-for-Profit providers represented by District Council 1707/Local 205 of AFSCME and The Council of Supervisors and Administrators (CSA) to serve as their representative in all collective bargaining issues negotiations and agreements.  Additionally, The Council provides grievance-mediation services, recruitment and personnel assistance.  Training and technical assistance is also provided to ensure consistency and efficiency throughout the childcare community.

ACS cannot perform these negotiations with the unions on behalf of the contracted agencies and their staffs, because ACS is not the employer.  However, City funding is used to adjudicate any grievances, fund collective bargaining issues and other negotiations affecting contracts with our child care vendors.  It is therefore advantageous to the City to provide funding to The Council to advocate for ACS’ not-for-profit agencies.  Additionally, based upon correspondence from the City of New York’s Office of Labor Relations (OLR) pertaining to lawsuits brought by unions against the City claiming the City was a “joint employer” with contract vendor agencies; the City prevailed in these cases because it was not a signatory to collective bargaining agreements between these unions and the vendor agencies and it did not directly provide wages or benefits to these employees.  The Council’s contract will eliminate the appearance that the City is a joint employer of the not-for-profit employees.

The Council’s unique expertise, service and configuration are the primary basis for this sole source method determination.  It conforms to the first condition for a sole source procurement, that there be only one source for the required service pursuant to section 3-05 of the PPB rules.
