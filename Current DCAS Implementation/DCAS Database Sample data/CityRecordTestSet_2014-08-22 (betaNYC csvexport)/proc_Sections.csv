The HHS Accelerator System is a web-based system maintained by the City of New York for use by its human services Agencies to manage procurement. To establish this, the City of New York is using the innovative procurement method, as permitted and in accordance with Section 3-12 of the Procurement Policy Board Rules of the City of New York (“PPB Rules”). The new process will remove redundancy by capturing information about boards, filings, policies, and general service experience centrally. As a result, specific proposals for funding will be more focused on program design, scope, and budget.</span><br/> <span>Important information about the new method <span/> <ul><li>Prequalification applications are required every three years</li><li>Documents related to annual corporate filings must be submitted on an annual basis to remain eligible to compete</li><li>Prequalification applications will be reviewed to validate compliance with corporate filings, organizational capacity, and relevant service experience</li><li>Approved organizations will be eligible to compete and would submit electronic proposals through the system.</li></ul><span><br/>RFPs to be managed by HHS Accelerator are listed on the NYC Procurement Roadmap located at http://www.nyc.gov/html/hhsaccelerator/html/roadmap/roadmap.shtml.
