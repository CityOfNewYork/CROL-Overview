The Property is comprised of a parcel of land in Central Harlem, Borough of Manhattan, situated between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue on the north side of 125 th street, within a C4-7 zoning district. The proposed action is to facilitate an initiative by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, in coordination with the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) and the New York State Urban Development Corporation d/b/a Empire State Development (ESD), to allow for the implementation of approximately 450,000 gross square feet (gsf) of mixed-use residential, commercial and civic development (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;).

Pursuant to Section 14 of the New York State Urban Development Corporation Act, Chapter 174, Section 1 of the Laws of 1968, as amended, by letter dated August 1, 2013, the President of ESD requested that the City convey its ownership interest in the Property to ESD, and certified that the conveyance is necessary and convenient for ESD&rsquo;s corporate purposes, specifically for the implementation of the 121 West 125 th Street Land Use Improvement and Civic Project.

Article 303 requires annual inspections of boilers.&nbsp; Section 28-303.4 authorizes the Commissioner to set the inspection cycle, and section 28-303.7 allows rules regarding the filing of inspection reports. &nbsp; With the proposed amendments to these rules regarding the annual inspection cycles for boilers, the Department is addressing some administrative issues that affect the deadlines for inspection and submitting reports for high-pressure and low-pressure boilers. The proposed amendments would do the following: &nbsp; Allow the current inspection cycle that started on January 1, 2013, as a result of the 2012 inspection cycle extension due to Hurricane Sandy, to end on December 31, 2013. All subsequent inspection cycles for years after 2013 will start on January 1 and end on December 31 of the calendar year. These changes would establish the same annual inspection cycle that was used prior to the Department&rsquo;s cycle change in 2009. &nbsp; Create a conventional annual inspection cycle within a single calendar year that makes it easier for boiler owners to follow. These amendments will make it administratively easier for boiler owners and Department staff to identify the particular inspection cycle that the inspections and/or violations were filed and/or issued. &nbsp; Allow the Department to more easily calculate fees. The Department charges monthly late fees for inspection reports filed after the inspection cycle deadline. Adjusting the annual boiler inspection cycle period to start on January 1 and end on December 31 would allow the Department to more easily calculate and determine when it should assess monthly late fees. &nbsp; Make sure that the boiler owner is properly filing records with the Department that are consistent with the active boilers present in the building. These amendments will allow inspection records to be maintained more accurately and the Department to account for boilers in use in city buildings. &nbsp; Alert the Department to the dangerous conditions caused by unregistered boilers. The Department deems unregistered boilers to be a dangerous condition that could threaten the life and safety of building occupants. These amendments allow the Department to be more aware of unregistered boilers by requiring inspectors to immediately notify the Department upon discovering an unregistered boiler during an inspection. &nbsp; Add to the low pressure boiler rule a provision regarding expired inspections that is in the high pressure boiler rule. &nbsp; &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo; denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. &nbsp; New text is underlined ; deleted material is in [brackets].&nbsp; &nbsp; This rule was not included in the agency&rsquo;s most recent regulatory agenda as it was not contemplated at the time the agenda was published. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 1. &nbsp;Subparagraph (ii) of paragraph 5 of subdivision (c) of section 101-07 of title 1 of the rules of the city of New York is amended to read as follows: &nbsp; (ii) [Effective January 1, 2009, periodic] Periodic boiler inspections required by section 28-303.2 of the Administrative Code shall be performed in compliance with the following requirements: &nbsp; &sect;2. &nbsp;Clause (B) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph 5 of subdivision (c) of section 101-07 of title 1 of the rules of the city of New York is amended to read as follows: &nbsp; (B) A low pressure boiler annual inspection must be conducted between [November 16th of the preceding calendar year through November 15th] January 1st and December 31st of the calendar year for which an owner submits the report [is being submitted at a date that follows the preceding annual inspection by 6 months or more]. Low pressure boiler annual inspections must be conducted at least six months apart. &nbsp;The inspector must verify that a valid department-issued boiler number is affixed to the boiler and such number must be used in all correspondence between the inspector and the department. If an inspection reveals any dangerous condition in a boiler that threatens life or safety and that requires an immediate shut down of the boiler, or reveals an unregistered boiler, the inspector must immediately notify the boiler division at the department of the condition via fax or email at the number or address provided on the department&#39;s website, http://www.nyc.gov/buildings . &nbsp; &sect;3. &nbsp;Paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of subdivision (c) of section 103-01 of title 1 of the rules of the city of New York are amended to read as follows: &nbsp; (1) Filing deadline.

Inspection reports filed after the forty-five (45) day filing deadline but within twelve (12) months of the inspection date will be considered late filings and will be subject to the appropriate civil penalties as set forth in subdivision (f) of this section.

In such cases, owners will be subject to the appropriate civil penalties for failure to file an inspection report, as set forth in subdivision (f) of this section, and the department will require a new inspection to be performed for the current inspection cycle and a new report filed in accordance with this section. &nbsp; &sect;6. Paragraphs 5 and 8 of subdivision (c) of section 103-05 of title 1 of the rules of the city of New York are amended to read as follows: &nbsp; (5) Inspection cycle. [November 16th of the preceding calendar year] January 1st through [November 15th] December 31st of the calendar year for which an owner submits the report [is being submitted]. &nbsp; (8) Late filing .

If an inspection reveals any dangerous condition in a boiler that threatens life or safety and that requires an immediate shutdown of the boiler, or reveals an unregistered boiler, the inspector [shall] must immediately notify the department&rsquo;s boiler division of the condition via fax or email at the number or address provided on the department&rsquo;s website, http://www.nyc.gov/buildings . &nbsp; &sect;8. Subdivision (f) of section 103-05 of title 1 of the rules of the city of New York is amended to read as follows: &nbsp; (f) Acceptance of filings.

 <strong>STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The following rule amendments are proposed pursuant to the authority of the Commissioner of Buildings under Section 643 and 1043(a) of the New York City Charter and Article 303 of Title 28 of the New York City Administrative Code. Article 303 requires annual inspections of boilers.&nbsp; Section 28-303.4 authorizes the Commissioner to set the inspection cycle, and section 28-303.7 allows rules regarding the filing of inspection reports.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 With the proposed amendments to these rules regarding the annual inspection cycles for boilers, the Department is addressing some administrative issues that affect the deadlines for inspection and submitting reports for high-pressure and low-pressure boilers. The proposed amendments would do the following:</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Allow the current inspection cycle that started on January 1, 2013, as a result of the 2012 inspection cycle extension due to Hurricane Sandy, to end on December 31, 2013. All subsequent inspection cycles for years after 2013 will start on January 1 and end on December 31 of the calendar year. These changes would establish the same annual inspection cycle that was used prior to the Department&rsquo;s cycle change in 2009.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Create a conventional annual inspection cycle within a single calendar year that makes it easier for boiler owners to follow. These amendments will make it administratively easier for boiler owners and Department staff to identify the particular inspection cycle that the inspections and/or violations were filed and/or issued.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Allow the Department to more easily calculate fees. The Department charges monthly late fees for inspection reports filed after the inspection cycle deadline. Adjusting the annual boiler inspection cycle period to start on January 1 and end on December 31 would allow the Department to more easily calculate and determine when it should assess monthly late fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Make sure that the boiler owner is properly filing records with the Department that are consistent with the active boilers present in the building. These amendments will allow inspection records to be maintained more accurately and the Department to account for boilers in use in city buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Alert the Department to the dangerous conditions caused by unregistered boilers. The Department deems unregistered boilers to be a dangerous condition that could threaten the life and safety of building occupants. These amendments allow the Department to be more aware of unregistered boilers by requiring inspectors to immediately notify the Department upon discovering an unregistered boiler during an inspection.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Add to the low pressure boiler rule a provision regarding expired inspections that is in the high pressure boiler rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo; denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p>

<p>
 The City Council enacted Local Law 9 of 2013 amending section 20-672 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York to require that all gas stations post road signs displaying the total selling price of gasoline or diesel motor fuel. The law also requires that, where the total selling price for purchases made with cash is less than for purchases made with another form of payment, such as debit or credit card, the road signs disclose the total selling price for cash, debit card and credit purchases.&nbsp; The rule amends 6 RCNY 4-63(b) to implement the requirements of Local Law 9.</p>

 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The rule amends 6 RCNY 4-63(b)(1) to require gas stations to post a road sign not less than 60 inches wide and 36 inches high advertising the price of the petroleum products for sale.&nbsp; The current rule does not require such a sign, but only sets forth the required content of a sign if the gas station chooses to advertise the petroleum product for sale.&nbsp;</p>

 The rule adds a new subparagraph (iv) to 6 RCNY 4-63(b)(2) to require that, when the price of the petroleum product is less for a cash purchase than other forms of purchase, the mandated road sign and all other curb signs advertising the sale of gasoline and diesel motor fuel must display the total selling price per gallon with cash, debit card, credit card or other form of payment for each grade of the petroleum product offered for sale.</p>
<p>

 <strong>STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 On July 31, 2013, Chapter 250 of the Laws of 2013 was enacted, effective immediately, which added a new section 467-g to the Real Property Tax Law. In accordance with Chapter 250, Local Law 67 of 2013 (enacted on August 12, 2013 and deemed effective July&nbsp; 31, 2013) added a new section 11-240 to the New York City Administrative Code to grant a rebate of real property taxes to owners of certain real property seriously damaged by Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Section 11-240 provides a rebate of real property taxes for any tax lot in the City that contained property on which there is a building that the Department of Buildings has determined to be seriously damaged and unsafe to enter or occupy or completely demolished as a result of the effects of Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The law provides that the rebate be paid to the owner who owned the building on October 30, 2012.&nbsp; Because many of these property owners may have been forced to relocate, the Department of Finance anticipates that some of the rebate checks that are mailed to such owners will not be received and thus not cashed or deposited.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 In order to ensure that the best effort is made to provide the benefit of the rebate in the most efficient way to such owners, these rules authorize the Commissioner of Finance to credit the amount of the rebate to real property taxes and real property-related charges imposed on the real property where the rebate applies.&nbsp; The credit will be made if the rebate check is not cashed or deposited within ninety days after the Department of Finance mailed the rebate check.&nbsp; This credit is to be made only if the owner who is entitled to the rebate remains the owner of the property. In the cases in which it is presumed that a rebate check has not been received by the property owner, providing the credit in this manner will give the property owner the benefit intended by the State Legislature and the City Council.</p>

 <strong>STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE </strong></p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Pursuant to &sect;&sect; 1043 and 2903 (a) of the New York City Charter, the Commissioner of Transportation is authorized to promulgate rules regarding the conduct of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the streets, squares, avenues, highways and parkways of the City as may be necessary.</p>
<p>

<p>
 <strong>Background&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Based upon recommendations from a truck study conducted in 2007 and a Maspeth Bypass Study which included truck origin and destination data, community meetings and local business and trucking industry requests for truck route changes, the Department of Transportation proposes to amend provisions of Title 34, Section 4-13 of the Rules of the City of New York in order to establish a more consistent designation of truck routes in the Borough of Queens.&nbsp; Specifically, the proposed rule:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Changes the designation of: 55<sup>th</sup> Drive, 56<sup>th</sup> Terrace, Flushing Avenue, Fresh Pond Road, Grand Avenue, Maspeth Avenue, and Page Place to Local Truck Routes.</li>
 <li>
  Dedesignates parts of Flushing Avenue, Fresh Pond Road and Grand Avenue as Local Truck Routes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 New matter in the following rule is underlined, and deleted material is in brackets.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;Shall and &ldquo;must&rdquo; denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of section 4-13 of Chapter 4 of Title 34 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended by adding, in alphabetical order, new entries for 55<sup>th</sup> Drive, 56<sup>th</sup> Terrace, Maspeth Avenue, and Page Place; and by deleting the entries for Flushing Avenue, Fresh Pond Road and Grand Avenue. The amendments read as follows:</p>

Goldman &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissioner of Finance &nbsp; Statement of Basis and Purpose &nbsp; The intercity bus industry has grown significantly over the last fifteen years. While intercity buses provide a useful service, their on-street operations can cause serious disruption to the local traffic network and risks to public safety. In certain communities within the City, the proliferation of these buses has led to an increase in traffic and sidewalk congestion; a higher concentration of on-street bus parking, double parking or blocking of travel lanes; and the creation of traffic and safety concerns for drivers, travelers, pedestrians and residents. &nbsp; In an effort to help address these concerns, New York State adopted Vehicle and Traffic Law (VTL) Section 1642-a, which authorized the City to establish an intercity bus permit system inclusive of a schedule of fines or civil penalties for violations of rules related to the system. The Parking Violations Bureau (PVB), a part of the Department of Finance (DOF), is authorized to adjudicate violations of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules pursuant to Section 1642-a and Article 2-B of the VTL.&nbsp; &nbsp; On April 10, 2013, the Mayor issued a letter designating the DOT to promulgate rules to implement and enforce the intercity bus permit system, and DOT has subsequently promulgated such rules (the &ldquo;DOT intercity bus permit system rules&rdquo;), found at 34 RCNY &sect;&sect; 4-01 and 4-10. The Mayor also designated the DOF and the ECB to promulgate rules setting forth fines or civil penalties for violations of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules. &nbsp; In coordination with the DOT and the New York City Police Department (NYPD), both DOF and ECB intend to establish penalty schedules for violations of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules as part of a coordinated enforcement scheme.&nbsp; In this rulemaking, DOF is amending 19 RCNY &sect; 39-05 to add civil penalties for such DOT violations returnable to the PVB. Violations of such enforcement codes will result in a civil penalty of $500 for each violation.&nbsp; It is anticipated that in a separate rulemaking, ECB will amend its DOT penalty schedule to include enforcement codes resulting in a civil penalty for first violations and enhanced penalties for repeat violators of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules, including violators of the DOF enforcement codes.&nbsp; &nbsp; Violations of the DOT Intercity Bus Permit System Rules &nbsp; These amendments to the DOT penalty schedule for offenses adjudicated at PVB involve the following violations of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules: &nbsp; &nbsp; Unauthorized passenger pickup or discharge in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(c)(1) The intent of implementing an intercity bus permit system is to ensure that intercity bus operators utilizing the City&rsquo;s curb space inform the DOT of their intended operations, and, once approved for such operations, adhere to permit requirements. In applying for a permit, bus operators will provide DOT with important information related to overall bus operations within the City necessary for administration of the program. &nbsp; &nbsp; Failure of an intercity bus permit holder to prominently display a copy of an intercity bus permit in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(d)(7)(ii) The prominent display of a copy of the intercity bus permit is necessary to assure that enforcement officers are easily able to identify buses with valid authorization to utilize the City&rsquo;s curb space. &nbsp; &nbsp; Failure of an intercity bus permit holder to properly display the operator&rsquo;s name, address and telephone number in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(d)(7)(iii) The operator&rsquo;s name, address, and telephone number must be affixed in characters at least five inches high on both sides of the vehicle, with such display being in a color contrasting with that of the vehicle and placed approximately midway vertically on doors or side panels. The operator&rsquo;s name, address, and telephone number are necessary to ensure that enforcement officers are easily able to identify buses with valid authorization to utilize the City&rsquo;s curb space. &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlawful stopping or standing in an assigned on-street bus stop location except when actively engaged in the pick-up or discharge of passengers by an intercity bus permit holder in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(d)(7)(v) Intercity bus permits are for the temporary utilization of curb space by approved bus operators in order to expeditiously pick up or discharge passengers. This code is necessary to ensure that permittees do not park or stand their vehicles in curb space and thereby create layover spaces in bus stops not intended for longer-term stops. &nbsp; &nbsp; Altering an intercity bus permit in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(d)(7)(vi) Prohibiting the alteration of an intercity bus permit is necessary to ensure that enforcement officers have the ability to easily determine whether permittees are adhering to permit requirements.&nbsp; &nbsp; New material is underlined . &nbsp; Amendment to Rules Relating to Intercity Bus Permit System &nbsp; Section 1. New subdivisions (s), (t), (u), (v) and (w) are added to section 39-05 of Chapter 39 of Title 19 of the Rules of the City of New York) to read as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (s) &nbsp; Unauthorized passenger pickup or discharge in violation of 34 RCNY &sect;4-10(c)(1) &nbsp; $500.00 &nbsp; (t) &nbsp; Failure of an intercity bus to prominently display a copy of an intercity bus permit in violation of 34 RCNY &sect;4-10(d)(7)(ii) &nbsp; $500.00 &nbsp; (u) &nbsp; Failure of an intercity bus to properly display the operator&rsquo;s name,&nbsp; address and telephone number in violation of 34 RCNY &sect;4-10(d)(7)(iii) &nbsp; $500.00 &nbsp; (v) &nbsp; Stopping or standing by an intercity bus in its assigned on-street bus stop location except when actively engaged in the pick-up or discharge of passengers in violation of 34 RCNY &sect;4-10(d)(7)(v) &nbsp; $500.00 &nbsp; (w) &nbsp; Altering an intercity bus permit in violation of 34 RCNY &sect;4-10(d)(7)(vi) &nbsp; $500.00 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"<p align=""center"">

 <strong><u>Statement of Basis and Purpose</u></strong></p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The intercity bus industry has grown significantly over the last fifteen years. While intercity buses provide a useful service, their on-street operations can cause serious disruption to the local traffic network and risks to public safety. In certain communities within the City, the proliferation of these buses has led to an increase in traffic and sidewalk congestion; a higher concentration of on-street bus parking, double parking or blocking of travel lanes; and the creation of traffic and safety concerns for drivers, travelers, pedestrians and residents.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 In an effort to help address these concerns, New York State adopted Vehicle and Traffic Law (VTL) Section 1642-a, which authorized the City to establish an intercity bus permit system inclusive of a schedule of fines or civil penalties for violations of rules related to the system. The Parking Violations Bureau (PVB), a part of the Department of Finance (DOF), is authorized to adjudicate violations of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules pursuant to Section 1642-a and Article 2-B of the VTL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 On April 10, 2013, the Mayor issued a letter designating the DOT to promulgate rules to implement and enforce the intercity bus permit system, and DOT has subsequently promulgated such rules (the &ldquo;DOT intercity bus permit system rules&rdquo;), found at 34 RCNY &sect;&sect; 4-01 and 4-10. The Mayor also designated the DOF and the ECB to promulgate rules setting forth fines or civil penalties for violations of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 In coordination with the DOT and the New York City Police Department (NYPD), both DOF and ECB intend to establish penalty schedules for violations of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules as part of a coordinated enforcement scheme.&nbsp; In this rulemaking, DOF is amending 19 RCNY &sect; 39-05 to add civil penalties for such DOT violations returnable to the PVB. Violations of such enforcement codes will result in a civil penalty of $500 for each violation.&nbsp; It is anticipated that in a separate rulemaking, ECB will amend its DOT penalty schedule to include enforcement codes resulting in a civil penalty for first violations and enhanced penalties for repeat violators of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules, including violators of the DOF enforcement codes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p align=""center"">
 <u>Violations of the DOT Intercity Bus Permit System Rules</u></p>
<p align=""center"">
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 These amendments to the DOT penalty schedule for offenses adjudicated at PVB involve the following violations of the DOT intercity bus permit system rules:</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  &nbsp;</li>
 <li>
  <u>Unauthorized passenger pickup or discharge in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(c)(1) </u></li>
</ul>
<p>
 The intent of implementing an intercity bus permit system is to ensure that intercity bus operators utilizing the City&rsquo;s curb space inform the DOT of their intended operations, and, once approved for such operations, adhere to permit requirements. In applying for a permit, bus operators will provide DOT with important information related to overall bus operations within the City necessary for administration of the program.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  &nbsp;</li>
 <li>
  <u>Failure of an intercity bus permit holder to prominently display a copy of an intercity bus permit in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(d)(7)(ii) </u></li>
</ul>
<p>
 The prominent display of a copy of the intercity bus permit is necessary to assure that enforcement officers are easily able to identify buses with valid authorization to utilize the City&rsquo;s curb space.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  &nbsp;</li>
 <li>
  <u>Failure of an intercity bus permit holder to properly display the operator&rsquo;s name, address and telephone number in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(d)(7)(iii)</u></li>
</ul>
<p>
 The operator&rsquo;s name, address, and telephone number must be affixed in characters at least five inches high on both sides of the vehicle, with such display being in a color contrasting with that of the vehicle and placed approximately midway vertically on doors or side panels. The operator&rsquo;s name, address, and telephone number are necessary to ensure that enforcement officers are easily able to identify buses with valid authorization to utilize the City&rsquo;s curb space.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  &nbsp;</li>
 <li>
  <u>Unlawful stopping or standing in an assigned on-street bus stop location except when actively engaged in the pick-up or discharge of passengers by an intercity bus permit holder in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(d)(7)(v) </u></li>
</ul>
<p>
 Intercity bus permits are for the temporary utilization of curb space by approved bus operators in order to expeditiously pick up or discharge passengers. This code is necessary to ensure that permittees do not park or stand their vehicles in curb space and thereby create layover spaces in bus stops not intended for longer-term stops.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  &nbsp;</li>
 <li>
  <u>Altering an intercity bus permit in violation of 34 RCNY &sect; 4-10(d)(7)(vi) </u></li>
</ul>
<p>
 Prohibiting the alteration of an intercity bus permit is necessary to ensure that enforcement officers have the ability to easily determine whether permittees are adhering to permit requirements.&nbsp;</p>

Under VTL Section 1180-b, vehicle operators who exceed the speed limit in school zones and who are recorded by a photo speed violation monitoring system will receive a summons for the violation. VTL Section 1180-b enables the City to use technology to improve the safety and quality of life of motorists and pedestrians by reducing speeding in school zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) will implement the demonstration program.&nbsp; DOT will maintain the photo speed violation monitoring systems, send notices of liability to motorists, and transmit information relating to violations to DOF.&nbsp; The proposed amendment establishes penalties for such violations, provides requirements for the notice of liability, and authorizes the PVB to adjudicate allegations of liability.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 DOF&rsquo;s authority for the proposed rule is found in sections 389(b) and 1043 of the New York City Charter and section 1180-b of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.</p>

<p>
 Under HPD&#39;s Low Income Program, sponsors purchase City-owned land or vacant buildings and construct or rehabilitate multifamily buildings in order to create affordable rental housing.&nbsp; Construction and permanent financing is provided through loans from private institutional lenders and from public sources including HPD, the New York City Housing Development Corporation, the State of New York, and the federal government.&nbsp; Additional funding may also be provided from the syndication of low-income housing tax credits.&nbsp; The newly constructed or rehabilitated buildings provide rental housing to low-income families. Subject to project underwriting, up to 20% of the units may be rented to formerly homeless families.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Under the proposed project, the City will sell the Disposition Area to Harlem Dowling Development Fund Company, Inc. (&quot;Sponsor&quot;) for the nominal price of one dollar per tax lot.&nbsp; The Sponsor will also deliver an enforcement note and mortgage for the remainder of the appraised value (&ldquo;Land Debt&rdquo;).&nbsp; The Sponsor will then construct one building containing a total of 60 rental dwelling units and approximately 15,925 square feet of community facility space on the Disposition Area.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The Land Debt will be repayable out of resale or refinancing profits for a period of thirty (30) years following completion of construction. The remaining balance, if any, may be forgiven in the 30th year.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The appraisal and the proposed Land Disposition Agreement and Project Summary are available for public examination at the office of HPD, 100 Gold Street, Room 5-A1, New York, New York on business days during business hours.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>

The affected area is generally bounded by Flushing Avenue, Evergreen Avenue, Melrose Street, Stanwix Street, Forrest Street, Garden Street, and Beaver Street. The Proposed Action would rezone all or portions of Blocks 3137, 3138, 3139, 3140, 3141 and 3152. The affected area is currently zoned M1-1 and M3-1, light and heavy manufacturing districts, respectively. The proposed zoning map amendment would rezone the area M1-2, R6A and R7A with selected C2-4 commercial overlays. The proposed zoning text amendment would establish the Inclusionary Housing program within the proposed R6A and R7A districts within the rezoning area. The City Map change would establish the section of Stanwix Street from Montieth Street to Forrest Street and the section of Noll Street between Evergreen Avenue and Stanwix Street as mapped streets. &nbsp; The Proposed Action would facilitate a proposal by the Applicant to redevelop four sites with 54,182 square feet (sf) of local retail space and 977 dwelling units (DUs), of which 242 DUs would be affordable to low-to-moderate-income households, per the Inclusionary Housing regulations (47 units would be set aside for senior housing) by 2016. For environmental analysis purposes, the FEIS projects that on the Applicant&rsquo;s sites the Proposed Action would result in a net increase of 54,182 sf of local retail space and 977 dwelling units (DUs), of which 195 DUs would be affordable to low-to-moderate-income households, per the Inclusionary Housing regulations. In addition, the Proposed Action could facilitate new development on four sites not under the applicant&rsquo;s control.&nbsp; On these properties, the Proposed Action could result in a net increase of 99 DUs, of which 20 DUs would be affordable per the Inclusionary Housing regulations, and 20,013 sf of local retail. In total, the Proposed Action is expected to result in development on eight (8) sites generating a net increase of approximately 1,076 DUs, of which 215 would be considered affordable, and 74,194 sf of local retail. &nbsp; The Proposed Action includes (E) designations (E-315) for hazardous materials, noise, and air quality. The (E) designation is a mechanism that ensures no significant adverse impacts would result from a proposed action because of steps that would be undertaken prior to the development of a rezoned site. The (E) designation would ensure that these identified sites would not be developed unless necessary remedial measures are implemented. &nbsp; The FEIS identifies potential significant adverse impacts related to open space, community facilities (elementary schools) and transportation (traffic). Measures to mitigate the community facilities and open space impacts were explored and evaluated in between the Draft and EIS in consultation with the New York City School Construction Authority (SCA), the New York City Department of Education (DOE), the New York City Department of Parks (DPR) and the lead agency, DCP. The FEIS identifies measures that would fully mitigate impacts for community facilities and traffic and partially mitigate open space impacts. Absent the implementation of the measures identified in the FEIS, the Proposed Action could have an unmitigated significant adverse impact on elementary schools. While the identified impact to open space could be partially mitigated with the measures identified in the FEIS, it would still constitute an unavoidable significant adverse impact on open space resources. As the significant adverse impact on open space would not be fully mitigated, the Proposed Action would result in an unavoidable adverse impact on open space. &nbsp; The FEIS evaluates three alternatives to the proposed action: a No Action Alternative, a Lower Density Alternative, and a No Impact Alternative. &nbsp; Copies of the FEIS are available for public inspection at the office of the undersigned.&nbsp; The proposal involves actions by the City Planning Commission and Council of the City of New York pursuant to Uniform Land Use Review Procedures (ULURP).&nbsp; A public hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was held on September 11, 2013.&nbsp; Written comments on the DEIS were requested and were received by the Lead Agency until September 23, 2013.&nbsp; The FEIS incorporates responses to the public comments received on the DEIS and additional analysis conducted subsequent to the completion of the DEIS.&nbsp; http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/env_review/eis.shtml ",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"<p align=""center"">

 Pursuant to City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR), Mayoral Executive Order No. 91 of 1977, CEQR Rules of Procedure of 1991 and the regulations of Article 8 of the State Environmental Conservation Law, State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) as found in 6 NYCRR Part 617, a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) has been prepared for the action described below.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The Applicant, Forrest Lots, LLC, is requesting a zoning map amendment, a zoning text amendment, and changes to the city map (collectively, the &ldquo;Proposed Action&rdquo;) affecting an approximately 6 block area within the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, Community District 4. The affected area is generally bounded by Flushing Avenue, Evergreen Avenue, Melrose Street, Stanwix Street, Forrest Street, Garden Street, and Beaver Street. The Proposed Action would rezone all or portions of Blocks 3137, 3138, 3139, 3140, 3141 and 3152. The affected area is currently zoned M1-1 and M3-1, light and heavy manufacturing districts, respectively. The proposed zoning map amendment would rezone the area M1-2, R6A and R7A with selected C2-4 commercial overlays. The proposed zoning text amendment would establish the Inclusionary Housing program within the proposed R6A and R7A districts within the rezoning area. The City Map change would establish the section of Stanwix Street from Montieth Street to Forrest Street and the section of Noll Street between Evergreen Avenue and Stanwix Street as mapped streets.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The Proposed Action would facilitate a proposal by the Applicant to redevelop four sites with 54,182 square feet (sf) of local retail space and 977 dwelling units (DUs), of which 242 DUs would be affordable to low-to-moderate-income households, per the Inclusionary Housing regulations (47 units would be set aside for senior housing) by 2016. For environmental analysis purposes, the FEIS projects that on the Applicant&rsquo;s sites the Proposed Action would result in a net increase of 54,182 sf of local retail space and 977 dwelling units (DUs), of which 195 DUs would be affordable to low-to-moderate-income households, per the Inclusionary Housing regulations. In addition, the Proposed Action could facilitate new development on four sites not under the applicant&rsquo;s control.&nbsp; On these properties, the Proposed Action could result in a net increase of 99 DUs, of which 20 DUs would be affordable per the Inclusionary Housing regulations, and 20,013 sf of local retail. In total, the Proposed Action is expected to result in development on eight (8) sites generating a net increase of approximately 1,076 DUs, of which 215 would be considered affordable, and 74,194 sf of local retail.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The Proposed Action includes (E) designations (E-315) for hazardous materials, noise, and air quality. The (E) designation is a mechanism that ensures no significant adverse impacts would result from a proposed action because of steps that would be undertaken prior to the development of a rezoned site. The (E) designation would ensure that these identified sites would not be developed unless necessary remedial measures are implemented.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The FEIS identifies potential significant adverse impacts related to open space, community facilities (elementary schools) and transportation (traffic). Measures to mitigate the community facilities and open space impacts were explored and evaluated in between the Draft and EIS in consultation with the New York City School Construction Authority (SCA), the New York City Department of Education (DOE), the New York City Department of Parks (DPR) and the lead agency, DCP. The FEIS identifies measures that would fully mitigate impacts for community facilities and traffic and partially mitigate open space impacts. Absent the implementation of the measures identified in the FEIS, the Proposed Action could have an unmitigated significant adverse impact on elementary schools. While the identified impact to open space could be partially mitigated with the measures identified in the FEIS, it would still constitute an unavoidable significant adverse impact on open space resources. As the significant adverse impact on open space would not be fully mitigated, the Proposed Action would result in an unavoidable adverse impact on open space.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The FEIS evaluates three alternatives to the proposed action: a No Action Alternative, a Lower Density Alternative, and a No Impact Alternative.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Copies of the FEIS are available for public inspection at the office of the undersigned.&nbsp; The proposal involves actions by the City Planning Commission and Council of the City of New York pursuant to Uniform Land Use Review Procedures (ULURP).&nbsp; A public hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was held on September 11, 2013.&nbsp; Written comments on the DEIS were requested and were received by the Lead Agency until September 23, 2013.&nbsp; The FEIS incorporates responses to the public comments received on the DEIS and additional analysis conducted subsequent to the completion of the DEIS.&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/env_review/eis.shtml"">http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/env_review/eis.shtml</a></p>
