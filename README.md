## About

As the City embarks on implementing Intro 363-2014 and unlocking its daily actions, we are working together with the Department of Citywide Services to publish the City Record as open, clean and structured data. At the same time, we are unlocking decades of historical information and making it accessible to all, at no charge. 

Our goal is to optimize the utility of City Record content by making accessible and structuring the data; addresses, dates, persons, subjects, agencies, contract types and more are parsed and made available as individual objects. This way, residents, organizations and small and large businesses alike will be able to access, interact and stay informed, whether through notifications, visualizations or other easy-to-use community tools.

## Tasks
For a list of current tasks, please see Issues.

### Phase 1: Parsers and Schema
* Develop a set of collaboratively produced open source library parsers to populate the Public Notice Data Standard schema using the DCAS pipeline 

* Work with DCAS to implement the pipeline into the City’s workflow by August 1, and use that as their way of publishing the City Record data

* Publish a Public Notice Data Standard and documentation on an interactive website

### Phase 2: PDF Scraping
* Scrape the archival PDFs
* Apply and modify the parsers to be able to parse and structure the data in the PDFs
