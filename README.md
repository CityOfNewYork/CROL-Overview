## About
As the City embarks on implementing Intro 363-2014 and unlocking its daily actions, we are building a public workgroup to unlock the decades of historical information and make it accessible to all, at no charge. 

Our groupâ€™s goal is to disassemble digital copies of City Record and convert them into usable notifications, words, dates, and events. We want to make solicitation procurement notices and awards, public hearings, meetings, court notices, property dispositions, agency public hearings, agency rules, and changes in personnel into a powerful archive for all. 

This project will start by converting the City Record PDFs, with more than 15 years of data, into usable information. Facilitated by BetaNYC and Socrata, we will turn these files into a first class collection of information that builds a smarter city. Through this process businesses, community groups, academics, and the public will learn how their City government works. This unique collaboration of government, industry, hackers, and advocates, illustrates that opening up data isn't just about transparency but actually building smarter, more inclusive, and resilient governance.

## Download PDFs
Currently, we are working on developing a number of outlets to download this treasure trove of information. In total, there are 16.3 gigs of archival PDFs. 
* 1998 to 2008 are scaned documents (BitTorrent Sync, HTML/XML)
* March 2008 till present are 'text selectable' (BitTorrent Sync, HTML/XML and Google Docs)

### Google Docs
We are in the process of uploading all of the documents. For now, you can only access the text selectable documents (March 2008 till present) via http://bit.ly/gdocs-crow 

### HTML/XML
* [Browse All City Records](http://www.nyc.gov/html/misc/html/cityrecord/cityrecord.html)
* [Download XML Listing for All City Records](http://www.nyc.gov/html/misc/html/cityrecord/cityrecord.xml)

### BitTorrent (shareable link bit.ly/bts-crow)
For now, there is 16.3 gigs of archival PDFs that are via the [BitTorrent protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent). This is the complete set.
