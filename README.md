## About
As the City embarks on implementing Intro 363-2014 and unlocking its daily actions, we are building a public workgroup to unlock the decades of historical information and make it accessible to all, at no charge. 

Our groupâ€™s goal is to disassemble digital copies of City Record and convert them into usable notifications, words, dates, and events. We want to make solicitation procurement notices and awards, public hearings, meetings, court notices, property dispositions, agency public hearings, agency rules, and changes in personnel into a powerful archive for all. 

This project will start by converting the City Record PDFs, with more than 15 years of data, into usable information. Facilitated by BetaNYC and Socrata, we will turn these files into a first class collection of information that builds a smarter city. Through this process businesses, community groups, academics, and the public will learn how their City government works. This unique collaboration of government, industry, hackers, and advocates, illustrates that opening up data isn't just about transparency but actually building smarter, more inclusive, and resilient governance.

* Download PDFs
For now, there is 1.5 gigs of archival PDFs that are 'text selectable.' The best way to share these files is via the [BitTorrent protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent). 

The first step in this project is downloaded and sharing the files using [BitTorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/get-started). To download and socialize these PDFs, you will need to download [BitTorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/get-started) and use the following read-only 'secret' passcode "BDGM4KAQHZ6XII2JNJREDX6VDN3QTLI7G"
