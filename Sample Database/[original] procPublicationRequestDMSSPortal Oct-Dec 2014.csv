It is necessary to relocate the panels in order to extend a corridor that is currently blocked by the wall on which the panels are located (see attached plan).  The corridor in question must be extended to maintain circulation and egress on the 4th floor that will be lost when DANY’s Cybercrimes and Identity Theft Unit (CITB) is renovated and expanded. This expansion will absorb a section of the circulation corridor which will then be replaced by extending the corridor blocked by the electric panels in question. Please see the attached drawings.   The CITB renovation is part of a major initiative of the District Attorney’s to combat the increasing instances of identity theft and cybercrime. A grant has been secured to fund the expansion and the District Attorney is anxious that the new facility be up and running as quickly as possible. The CITB   The CITB renovation is scheduled to begin on or about December 15th, 2014 and be complete in approximately seven (7) months. However the renovation cannot begin until the electric panels have been relocated..  The electric panels were installed as part of a building-wide electrical upgrade initiated by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) in 2011, and expected to be completed in 2015.  The panels were installed by ARK Systems Electric, the contractor hired for the project, under work permit #M331936 issued by the NYC Department of Buildings (copy attached). This permit remains ‘open’ until the overall project is completed, inspected and signed off by the Department of Buildings (DOB).  As per section 26-207 of the New York City Building Code, no work may be done without a permit being issued by the DOB. Since the permit is issued to a specific contractor, only that contractor may perform the work covered by the permit, including alteration of work already installed under the permit, until the work covered by the permit is completed, inspected and signed off by the DOB and the permit ‘closed’. Thus only ARK Systems Electric may relocate these panels until the overall project is completed in 2015 and the permit ‘closed’.   The renovation and expansion of the CITB unit is a pivotal component of District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance’s strategy to combat one of the fastest growing sectors of crime worldwide. The renovation is scheduled to begin in December of this year and be completed and occupied by the middle of August of 2015. The panels must be relocated by the start of construction. Waiting until the building-wide electrical upgrade is completed in 2015, in order to seek competitive bids from multiple electrical contractors to relocate the panels, would substantially delay this project and would also delay an important crime prevention initiative.   Because DCAS prefers not to issue a change order to the contractor for the panel relocation, nor to revise the scope of the electrical upgrade project to accommodate the relocation, DANY has agreed to fund the work and hire the contractor as a separate project. We are thus seeking to retain ARK Systems Electric to relocate the panels, under their current permit, concurrent with the building-wide electrical upgrade. We thus respectfully request concurrence with our plan to pursue a negotiated acquisition with ARK System Electric  ||||RELOCATE ELECTRICAL PANEL - Negotiated Acquisition - PIN# 20150600061 - Due 12-24-14 at 3:00 P.M.

The Office of Pupil Transportation (OPT) also schedules bus service for more than 160,000 field trips every year.  The DOE does not own any school buses and thus contracts for that service with more than 50 private companies for over 8,600 buses to transport riders to and from more than 3,000 schools.  This RFP seeks to engage the services of a consultant (which may be an individual, a team or a firm) to analyze, evaluate and document OPT’s current management of bus routing from technical, business process and resource perspectives.  The consultant will also recommend any refinements and/or additions to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of those processes that should be included in any future solution. The resulting requirements document will be used to decide if OPT should buy a bus routing software package or to develop one or some combination of the two that would involve enhancing processes and systems already in place or in development.  The consultant must not have any affiliation with any bus routing software vendor and will not be allowed to submit a Proposal or Bid for such services as may be sought as a result of the recommendations made in fulfillment of this RFP.  In addition, consulting contracts require that software vendors have not and will not pay the consultant any compensation as a result of any routing solution growing out of this RFP.

The DOE is seeking proposals from organizations with the demonstrated ability to provide consulting services to define evaluate, document and recommend technology and business processes to support school bus routing operations for over 150,000 students who ride buses each day in the New York City metropolitan area to public, non-public, and charter schools. The Office of Pupil Transportation (OPT) also schedules bus service for more than 160,000 field trips every year.  The DOE does not own any school buses and thus contracts for that service with more than 50 private companies for over 8,600 buses to transport riders to and from more than 3,000 schools.  This RFP seeks to engage the services of a consultant (which may be an individual, a team or a firm) to analyze, evaluate and document OPT’s current management of bus routing from technical, business process and resource perspectives.  The consultant will also recommend any refinements and/or additions to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of those processes that should be included in any future solution. The resulting requirements document will be used to decide if OPT should buy a bus routing software package or to develop one or some combination of the two that would involve enhancing processes and systems already in place or in development.  The consultant must not have any affiliation with any bus routing software vendor and will not be allowed to submit a Proposal or Bid for such services as may be sought as a result of the recommendations made in fulfillment of this RFP.  In addition, consulting contracts require that software vendors have not and will not pay the consultant any compensation as a result of any routing solution growing out of this RFP.  The RFP may result in award of one (1) full value contract for a base term of one (1) year with an option to extend the contract for two (2) nine (9) month periods.
