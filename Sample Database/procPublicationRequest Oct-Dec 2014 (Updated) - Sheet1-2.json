  "AdditionalDescription": "Release of the Draft Scope of Work for Water for the Future Upstate Water\nSupply Resiliency Project and Schedule of Public Meetings\n\n\n\nTo repair significant leaks in the Rondout-West Branch Tunnel (RWBT) of the\nDelaware Aqueduct, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection\n(DEP) developed the Water for the Future Program (WFF).  As part of the\nprogram, DEP elected to construct a bypass tunnel and two associated shafts to\npermanently circumvent the leaking section of the tunnel at the Roseton\ncrossing in the Town of Newburgh, NY, and to conduct internal repairs to the\nleaking section in Wawarsing, NY.  This project was previously evaluated in a\nFEIS issued on May 18, 2012, and work has commenced.\n\n\n\nOnce the tunnel and shafts are completed in 2022, the RWBT would be\ntemporarily shut down and drained to connect the bypass tunnel to the existing\nRWBT and to carry out internal repairs. DEP estimates that the maximum\nshutdown duration would be approximately eight months. During this temporary\nshutdown of the RWBT, water from the Delaware system west of the Hudson River\nwould be unavailable. To ensure the continued supply of clean drinking water\nduring this time, DEP has developed projects and plans comprised of three main\ncomponents: (1) supply augmentation consisting of  rehabilitation of the\nCatskill Aqueduct and rehabilitation of groundwater supply stations in Queens;\n(2) WFF Shutdown System Operations, which would allow DEP to rely more heavily\non the Catskill and Croton water supply systems during the temporary shutdown;\nand (3) Inspection and Repair of the RWBT during connection of the bypass\ntunnel, including decommissioning the bypassed section of the RWBT once the\nconnection is completed.\n\n\n\nThe subject of this draft scope and EIS is comprised of the rehabilitation of\nthe Catskill Aqueduct, WFF Shutdown System Operations, and Inspection and\nRepair of the RWBT. These components collectively will be referred to as\nUpstate Water Supply Resiliency in the Draft Scope of Work. The Queens\nGroundwater Rehabilitation project will be referred to as In-City Water Supply\nResiliency, which will be the subject of a subsequent environmental review.\n\n\n\nThe public comment period will remain open until December 5, 2014, and a Final\nScope of Work, incorporating changes based on relevant comments received, will\nbe issued.\n\n\n\nThe Draft Scope of Work was issued on October 10, 2014 and is available for\nreview on the DEP website. DEP will hold public meetings for public comment on\nthe Upstate Water Supply Resiliency Draft Scope of Work with informal\ninformation and listening sessions taking place one hour prior to the meeting\ntimes on:\n\n\n\nThursday, November 13, 2014, at 7:00 PM\n\nTown of Newburgh Town Hall, 1496 Route 300, Newburgh, NY  12550\n\n\n\nFriday, November 14, 2014, at 7:00 PM\n\nSUNY Sullivan \u2013 Paul Grossinger Dining Room\n\n112 College Road, Loch Sheldrake, NY 12759\n\n\n\nWednesday, November 19, 2014, at 7:00 PM\n\nEllenville Government Center, 2 Elting Court, Ellenville, NY 12428\n\n\n\nThursday, November 20, 2014 at 7:00 PM\n\nYorktown Town Hall, Town Board Room\n\n363 Underhill Avenue, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598\n\n",
